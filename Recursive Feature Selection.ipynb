After feature rank 8 is added, the performance of COVID stats being added atually makes the predictions worse. This leads me to believe we have found no evidence that the amount of COVID cases per capita has effected a county's voting one way or the other. At the very least, I am confident in saying that COVID cases and deaths were not a strong predictor of election outcome and likely did not play a strong direct role.
